# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

Due September 8th 2018

### Overview

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

You will use Express to handle routing.

### Before You Begin

* Check out [this demo version of the site](https://friend-finder-fsf.herokuapp.com/). It's not exactly what is described below, but will give you an idea of what to create.

* Create a folder called `friend_finder`. Inside the folder, organize your directories so it matches the following:

  ```
  friend_finder
    - .gitignore
    - app
      - db
        - schema.sql
      - public
        - assets
          - css
          - javascript
        - your html goes here
    - node_modules
    - package.json
    - server.js
  ```

### Instructions

1. Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. Your `server.js` file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: `express`, `body-parser`, `path`, `mysql`, `method-override`, etc.

3. Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

   * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   * With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     * Example: 
       * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
   * Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on. 
   * The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

7. Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the results on a page
